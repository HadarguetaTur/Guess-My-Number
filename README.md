Guess My Number - DOM Implementation Welcome to the "Guess My Number" game, a fun and interactive project that showcases the power of JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. In this game, players are challenged to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. The project highlights various features and offers a visual DOM map to help you understand how DOM elements are interconnected.

Features Here are the key features of the "Guess My Number" game:

Objective: The game aims to guess the secret number hidden within the range of 1 to 20.

User Input: Players can enter their guesses into an input field.

Check Button: A "Check" button allows players to submit their guesses for evaluation.

Feedback Messages:

A "Too Low!" message is displayed if the guessed number is too low. A "Too High!" message is displayed if the guessed number is too high. A "Correct number!" message appears upon guessing the correct number. Score Tracking: The game starts with an initial score of 20. Each incorrect guess results in a one-point score deduction.

Score: The game keeps track of the player's high score, which represents their best performance in terms of the lowest score achieved.

Play Again: After each round or when the game is over, players can click the "Again!" button to reset the game while retaining the high score.

Responsive Design: The game's retro-inspired design adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an enjoyable user experience on different devices.

DOM Manipulation: The game relies on JavaScript's DOM manipulation to dynamically select and update HTML elements based on user interactions and game logic.
